### 3. `Component Architecture Design Challenge Solution`

Before diving deep into the solution, it's essential to highlight that this architecture seamlessly incorporates two pivotal components:

1. **Data Transformation Library**: The [data_transformation](../data_transformation) library, which we developed into in Task 2. It contains the requested data transformation functions.

2. **Concurrent Notifier Library**: This architecture integrates the concept of the [concurrent_notifier](../concurrent_notifier) library, as laid out in Task 1. While we haven't expanded on the complete implementation of this library, its foundational idea plays a pivotal role. The Concurrent Notifier is represented as a skeleton in this system, emphasizing its conceptual application rather than a full-fledged execution.

In response to the challenge of designing a component architecture for efficient integration with various ERPs, the following solution was crafted keeping in mind the objective of overcoming the inherent limitations of web service-based integrations.


#### The task:

- Design a component architecture, preferably with visual diagrams, that addresses the aforementioned inefficiencies and limitations.
- Ensure that the solution capitalizes on reusability, especially reusing previously written integration code.
- The solution should also be capable of handling data transformations and event triggers, reducing the need for frequent web service requests.
- Given that the system is multitenant, your design should also factor in the challenges and solutions pertaining to handling high data volumes, error management, and event retries.

#### Designed Architecture

The architecture is visually represented in a diagram, which can be found at:

#### Key Features of the Design:

1. **Event-driven Architecture**:
   To ensure real-time operations and minimize redundant web service requests, an event-driven architecture was adopted. The architecture employs an `Event Source` that pushes data to an `Event Producer`, which then funnels data into the `Event Broker (Kafka)`. This facilitates asynchronous data processing.

2. **Data Partitioning/Sharding**:
   Recognizing the challenges posed by high data volumes in a multi-tenant system, the architecture employs sharded databases. Sharding ensures data is spread across multiple storage locations, allowing for efficient data retrieval and scalability.

3. **Dedicated Cache Layer**:
   To enhance performance, especially for recurring queries, a cache layer comprising `Redis` nodes was implemented. This not only ensures swift data retrieval but also reduces load on the databases.

4. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms**:
   Robust error handling is critical in ensuring system resilience. Events or messages that fail are redirected to an `Error Queue`. A dedicated `Retry Service` reviews these errors and attempts to re-process them. Unresolved errors after retries are moved to a `Dead Letter Queue` for manual intervention or audit.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   With high data volume comes the necessity to monitor system health and performance. The `Prometheus` and `Grafana` combo provides real-time monitoring and alerting. Moreover, the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) ensures that every service logs essential metrics and errors for analysis.

6. **API Gateway**:
   To efficiently manage, route, and throttle the multiple incoming requests from various ERPs, an `API Gateway` is deployed. This not only ensures seamless integration with various ERPs but also aids in version management.

7. **Batch Processing**:
   Airflow is integrated for batch processing. It pulls data from the event queue, orchestrates the processing, and then directs it to transformation services, ensuring efficient and bulk data management.



#### Extensibility & Scalability:
The modular design of the architecture ensures that components can be added or removed without disrupting the entire system. For instance, adding new transformation rules or integrating with a new ERP can be achieved by plugging in a new service or library. This modularity, coupled with the event-driven nature of the architecture, ensures that the system remains scalable and extensible.
