```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository;

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
make init
```

3. **Run the Tests:**

```bash
make test
```

## Study Focus

1. **Code Optimization:** Dive into the provided code in `to_be_optimized.py` to understand its operations and explore avenues for optimization.

2. **Data Transformation Functions:** Develop and understand Python functions for various data transformation operations and design a main function to invoke them.

3. **Component Architecture Design:** Delve into creating an efficient design to integrate with web services, exploring its limitations and features.
