"""
Observer Pattern with Threading Optimization:

The original problem consisted of a server listening for a client request and then doing its own task.
These tasks were sequential and time-consuming, leading to longer overall execution time. This code
implements the Observer pattern with threading to optimize the execution time.

- Observer Pattern:
    The Observer pattern is used to allow an object (known as a subject) to notify other objects
    (known as observers) about changes without knowing who or what those observers are. This provides
    a decoupled architecture which is more scalable and maintainable.

- Threading:
    Threading is used to allow the server and the client to operate concurrently. This reduces the total
    time required to execute the program because the server and client no longer have to wait for one
    another to finish their tasks.

Together, these changes allow the server to notify the client and then immediately proceed with its own
tasks, while the client processes its request in parallel.
